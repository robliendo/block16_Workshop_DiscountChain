<!-- BLOCK 16 
 
1. Starter Code:

const timmy = {
    prescription: "acetaminophen",
    pricePerRefill: 25,
    refills: 3,
    subscription: false,
    coupon: true,
};

const sarah = {

*** returns the total cost of all refills including if the customer has a subscription and/or a coupon.

____ // If a customer has a subscription, 
// the customer will receive a 25% discount after the refill total has been calculated.

2. Using what we know about functions, pseudocode the prompt and a solution with your partner.

HINT: 

Despite this prompt being one large question, it can be broken down into three smaller prompts. 

Break your pseudocode into three smaller prompts.

Each of these small prompts should be addressed as an individual function.

Remember, a function should only do one task.

The returns of these functions should be stored in a variable, allowing other functions to use the result.


3. ____ Assign someone to be the driver for the current function.

4. ____ As you code, be sure to console.log or debug your solution.

5. ____ When a solution has been found, be sure to test all three customer objects.

6. ____ After the solution has been confirmed, move on to the next function and switch drivers.



____ Pseudocode
Pseudocode is present alongside the script.
Pseuducode breaks down the problem into three separate tasks.


____ This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeCorrect Output
The output returns the expected results.



____ Expected Results:

____ Timmy => "Your grand total is $65"

____ Sarah => "Your grand total is $37.5."

____ Rocky => "Your grand total is $102.5" -->
